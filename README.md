# Send It
[Live Link](https://sendit-trivia.herokuapp.com/)

A quick and fun trivia web application to test your general knowledge. This web application was made without a backend using React as the front end framework utilizing JavaScript.

## How to run the Code
This project is built with React so we will need to use a package manager, more specifically, npm, to get this working properly. Installing Node.js will automatically install npm on your computer. 
1. Open the terminal and Clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/dannythanhphan/sendit.git
2. Navigate to the root of the folder that was just made.
3. Run npm install.
4. When installation is finished, run npm start.
5. Go to localhost:3000

## Plans for the Future
* Give users the ability to see past questions + answers.
* Sound for correct and incorrect answers
